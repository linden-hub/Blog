# post 1 (testing)

Hello, Welcome to my blog! This is just a testing post to make sure everything is working. 

## What to expect from me here

Basically, I am going to be writing about anything that I want in this blog. Random thoughts, projects I'm working on, things that I've been doing, etc.


## Ignore the rest of this post please

function example() {
    console.log("I don't know how to code!");
}
```
