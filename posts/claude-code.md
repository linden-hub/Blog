## What is Claude Code?

I've been playing around with Claude Code lately, and I have to say—it's pretty impressive. For those who haven't heard of it, Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI tool that brings Claude directly into your terminal.

## Why I Like It

The main thing that sets it apart is how it works *with* your codebase. You can ask it to explore files, understand how things work, make edits, run commands, and even commit changes. It feels less like a chatbot and more like a pair programmer who actually understands the project you're working on.

Some things I've used it for:

- Debugging weird issues by having it trace through the code
- Writing new features while it handles the boilerplate
- Refactoring messy code into something cleaner
- Understanding unfamiliar codebases quickly

## The Terminal Experience

There's something satisfying about keeping everything in the terminal. No context switching to a browser, no copy-pasting code back and forth. You just describe what you want, and it gets to work.

## Final Thoughts

If you write code and haven't tried it yet, I'd recommend giving it a shot. It's become a regular part of my workflow now. You can check it out at [claude.ai/claude-code](https://claude.ai/claude-code).

Let me know if you've tried it—I'm curious what others think!
